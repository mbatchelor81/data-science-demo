description: Lays out packaging, API serving, containerization, scaling, monitoring, and retraining hooks for production use

## Overview
Deployment **serves the model to real‑time or batch consumers** under CI/CD control, with monitoring for drift and failures.

### Step 1 — Package for Inference
Bundle the model and preprocessing in a single artifact; expose a `predict()` entrypoint.

### Step 2 — Wrap as API Service
Implement a REST or gRPC endpoint using FastAPI or Flask; include health‑check and version routes.

### Step 3 — Containerize
Create a minimal Docker image (Alpine + Python) with pinned dependencies for deterministic runtime.

### Step 4 — Automate CI/CD
Trigger test, build, and deploy stages via GitHub Actions or Jenkins; gate on unit and integration tests.

### Step 5 — Orchestrate at Scale
Deploy containers on Kubernetes/Knative or serverless platforms (AWS Lambda, Cloud Run) depending on latency and load.

### Step 6 — Monitor & Roll Back
Track latency, error rate, and data drift (Evidently AI, Prometheus). Auto‑rollback on SLO breach.

### Step 7 — Schedule Retraining Hooks
Emit feature and prediction logs to storage; trigger pipeline retraining on drift or a temporal schedule.
