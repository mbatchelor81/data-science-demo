description: Shows how to systematically explore distributions and relationships to uncover insights and data issues

## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) **asks and answers “what’s in the data?”** through summaries and visuals before hypotheses or models.

### Step 1 — Understand Structure
Load the dataset; inspect shape, column names, and primary keys.

### Step 2 — Univariate Analysis
Plot distributions (histograms, bar charts) and compute central‑tendency and dispersion for each variable.

### Step 3 — Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
Use scatter, box, heat‑map, and pair‑plot to expose relationships, interactions, and multicollinearity.

### Step 4 — Missing & Anomaly Visualization
Visualize NaN patterns (e.g., `missingno` matrix) and leverage points to plan remediation.

### Step 5 — Feature Importance Heuristics
Compute simple correlations, Cramér’s V, or mutual information to rank predictive potential.

### Step 6 — Document Insights
Record key findings, assumptions, and open questions; save notebooks as immutable HTML for audit.
